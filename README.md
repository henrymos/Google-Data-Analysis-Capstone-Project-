Moreno, the Marketing Manager for Cyclistic Bike-Share tasked the Data Analysis team to determine the difference in usage between the company's casual bike riders and the annual member riders. 
This business goal is based on the fact that the company's profits have largely been from the annual members. The Marketing Manager's and company goal is to determine the difference in the casual riders and members so that the company can be in a position to convert the current casual riders to annual members.
